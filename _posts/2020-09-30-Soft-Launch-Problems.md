# Launch Problems

I probably don't need to be documenting this process on my website, but it's a way to gain experience and document at the same time.

Some parts are coming along nicely. I've been able to add new pages and deal with site navigation pretty easily. I'm having some more trouble figuring out how to display experience from my resume using collections with Jekyll.

I'm also hoping to get a better theme, maybe with some pictures. So far it looks like using one of the sample themes offered on Jekyll's page would involve re-doing a lot of the pages I've already created. So maybe best to avoid that for the time being.
