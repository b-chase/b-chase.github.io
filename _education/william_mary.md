* Senior thesis on the production of ultra-cold molecules in a dipole laser trap. Repaired an older model of a powerful laser. Measured the laser power and beam profile, then used Python and MATLAB to analyze the measurements and optimize the output.
* Economic research on income effects in a series experiments of participant risk tolerance. Cleaned data using Python and ran statistical analysis in Stata.
Reported that experiments conducted on the same day led to riskier behavior following early good luck.
