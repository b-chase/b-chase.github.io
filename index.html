	<h1>Hi There! I'm Brian Chase</h1>
	<p>I'm an economics grad with an undergraduate degree in physics. I like solving puzzles and learning new things.</p>

	<p>I'm hoping this small corner of the internet will serve as an introduction to me and my work. I suggest checking out my resume if you want to know more about my history, or the projects page to see what sorts of things I'm working on right now. I have a blog as well, but I'm not sure what I plan on doing with that just yet.</p>
	<p>Enjoy!</p>
